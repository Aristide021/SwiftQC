# SwiftQC v1.0.0 Release Notes

ðŸŽ‰ **First Stable Release** - July 16, 2025

SwiftQC v1.0.0 marks the initial stable release of a comprehensive property-based testing library for Swift, bringing modern testing capabilities to the Swift ecosystem with full Swift 6 compatibility.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

### Property-Based Testing
- **Automatic test case generation** with the `forAll` function
- **Intelligent shrinking** to minimal counterexamples when tests fail
- **Deterministic testing** with seed support for reproducible results
- **Comprehensive reporting** with Swift Testing integration

### Type System Integration
- **Native Swift 6 support** with full Sendable compliance
- **Arbitrary protocol** linking types to their generators and shrinkers
- **130+ built-in conformances** for Swift standard library types
- **Type-safe generators** preventing runtime errors

### Advanced Testing Modes

#### Stateful Testing
- Test complex state machines and stateful systems
- Generate and execute command sequences
- Automatic shrinking of failing command sequences
- Model-based validation against expected behavior

#### Parallel Testing
- Test concurrent systems for race conditions
- Detect model-system divergence in parallel execution
- Validate thread safety and consistency
- Built on Swift's modern concurrency model

### Developer Experience
- **Swift Testing integration** with seamless issue reporting
- **XCTest compatibility** for existing test suites
- **CLI tool** for interactive property testing
- **Comprehensive documentation** with examples and guides

## ðŸ“‹ What's Included

### Core Components
- **Property runners**: `forAll` with multiple overloads for ergonomic testing
- **Generator system**: Composable generators via PointFree's swift-gen
- **Shrinking system**: Pluggable shrinkers for all supported types
- **Arbitrary conformances**: Complete coverage of Swift standard library
- **State testing**: `StateModel` protocol and `stateful()` runner
- **Parallel testing**: `ParallelModel` protocol and `parallel()` runner

### Built-in Support For
- **Numeric types**: All integer and floating-point types
- **Collections**: Arrays, Dictionaries, Sets, and variants
- **Text types**: Strings, Characters, Unicode scalars
- **Foundation types**: Data, Date, URL, UUID, DateComponents
- **Generic types**: Optionals, Results, Ranges
- **Custom types**: Easy Arbitrary conformance for your types

### Infrastructure
- **Self-hosted CI/CD** with GitHub Actions
- **Multi-version testing** (Swift 6.0 and 6.1)
- **Code coverage** reporting with Codecov
- **Automated releases** with comprehensive validation

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

- **Swift 6.0+** (Xcode 16+)
- **Platforms**: 
  - macOS 12.0+
  - iOS 13.0+

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

### Swift Package Manager
```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/Aristide021/SwiftQC.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

### Quick Start
```swift
import SwiftQC
import Testing

@Test func reverseProperty() async {
    await forAll("reverse twice equals identity") { (array: [Int]) in
        #expect(array == array.reversed().reversed())
    }
}
```

## ðŸ”® Future Roadmap

- **Enhanced parallel testing** with linearizability checking
- **Performance benchmarking** integration
- **Additional Foundation types** support
- **IDE integrations** and tooling improvements
