## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in SwiftQC, please report it responsibly by following these steps:

### Private Disclosure

**Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to: **security@swiftqc.dev** (or if this email is not available, contact the maintainer directly)

Include the following information in your report:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact and attack scenarios
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations
- Your contact information for follow-up

### What to Expect

- **Initial Response**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- **Investigation**: We will investigate and validate the reported vulnerability
- **Timeline**: We aim to provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
- **Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress throughout the process
- **Resolution**: Once fixed, we will coordinate the disclosure timeline with you

### Disclosure Timeline

1. **Day 0**: Vulnerability reported
2. **Day 1-2**: Initial acknowledgment and triage
3. **Day 3-7**: Investigation and validation
4. **Day 8-30**: Development of fix and testing
5. **Day 31+**: Coordinated disclosure and release

### Security Considerations for SwiftQC

While SwiftQC is a testing library, security considerations include:

- **Code Generation**: Ensure generated test data doesn't expose sensitive information
- **Dependencies**: Monitor for vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Build Process**: Secure build and distribution pipeline
- **Test Isolation**: Prevent test code from affecting production systems

### Best Practices for Users

When using SwiftQC in your projects:

1. **Sensitive Data**: Avoid using real sensitive data in property-based tests
2. **Test Isolation**: Ensure tests don't access production systems
3. **Dependency Management**: Keep SwiftQC and its dependencies updated
4. **Code Review**: Review generated test cases for potential security implications

## Security Updates

Security updates will be:
- Released as soon as possible after validation
- Documented in release notes with appropriate severity levels
- Announced through GitHub releases and security advisories

## Bug Bounty

We do not currently offer a bug bounty program, but we greatly appreciate responsible disclosure and will acknowledge contributors in our security advisories when appropriate.
